# 👋 Hi, I’m Maria Petralia (MaPi)

## About Me
I’m an AI & Data Science trainee at Masterschool with a background in Computer Science and over a decade of experience in digital solutions. My journey started with a Spectrum computer and has grown into a passion for turning data into meaningful insights and visual stories.  

I work with **Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, data visualization, and Machine Learning**, building projects that span exploratory data analysis, dashboards, predictive modeling, and clustering. I enjoy combining **creativity and logic**, whether I’m designing vector graphics, analyzing datasets, or crafting clear and intuitive visual narratives.

I’m particularly interested in how data can explain behavior, reveal structure, and support decision‑making. My current focus is on supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and clean, reproducible workflows.

## Interests
- Data Analytics & Visualization  
- Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling
- Unsupervised Learning & Clustering 
- Visual storytelling with data  
- Continuous learning and resilience

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I find beauty in both **nature and numbers**. When I’m not analyzing data or creating vector images, you’ll find me designing cakes 🎂, tending to my garden 🌱, or practicing yoga & tai chi 🧘‍♀️. Creativity and logic are the two forces that shape my world.
