- 🌱 I’m currently learning for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

- ⚡ Fun fact: I find beauty in both nature and numbers! When I’m not designing cakes or tending to my garden, I’m diving into the world of informatics and mathematics. My journey with computers started with a Spectrum, and ever since, I’ve been fascinated by the magic of technology. From growing flowers to solving equations, I love how both creativity and logic shape the world around us! 🎂💻
